# CSE543 Final Project
## Team 3
- Team Members: Tommy Ahn,Junhao Lan, Hanqi Chen, Tillman James, Shane Canfield

# Descriptions
## Files: 
- big_output - folder containing csv files of the performance of the model given a specific risk aversion and covariance matrix 
- data - folder containing all the cvs files of the factors used in the expected return prediction with a various number of days per factor 
- monthly_returns - a folder containing the csv files of monthly returns for each of the 735 stocks used in our portfolio used to train the expected return regression model
- AR Models - Regression Analysis - Google Colab notebook used to investigate how the Autoregressive Model works 
- CSE543_Final_Project.ipynb -  Google Colab notebook used  to conduct our expire ment and produce the main results
- daily_price.csv - a csv file containing the daily price of all 735 stocks from Jan 1, 2000 to April 31, 2022 used to calculate the covariance matrix in the optimization algorithm
- stock_list.csv - list of 735 or so stock tickers used in our portfolio


## Results: 
In order for one to recreate the results achieved in our model, one must run the code blocks in the CSE543_Final_Project.ipynb in a consecutive manner. If one looks at the fine within the GitHub the results are clearly seen without actually having to run the file.  Some of the code blocks may take hours to run and it suggested that the user view the file rather than run it themselves.
